## 📌 - Key Topics

### File Descriptors
Understanding file descriptors is crucial for reading data in C. 
Each file descriptor represents an open file, socket, or other input/output resource, and it is managed by the operating system. 
The get_next_line function relies on the read() system call, which reads data from the specified file descriptor into a buffer. 
Mastery of file descriptor handling allows for efficient line-by-line reading from files and standard input.

### Static Variables
Static variables maintain their value between function calls, making them essential for tracking the state of the reading process in the get_next_line function. 
When dealing with multiple calls to get_next_line(), a static variable can store the buffer's state across these calls, enabling the function to return subsequent lines of input. 
Proper use of static variables is key to implementing a robust solution without using global variables, adhering to best practices in C programming.

## 🛠️ - Usage

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/kichkiro/get_next_line.git
cd get_next_line/
```
It's now possible to use the get_next_line() function by including the header files and source files.

The function prototype is __char *get_next_line(int fd);__
